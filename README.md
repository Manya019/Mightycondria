This project aims to create a comprehensive workflow that addresses mental health emergencies by combining speech-to-text technology with emotional analysis and first responder alerts.

Key Objectives:

1.Speech-to-Text Implementation:

Set up the openAI Speech-to-Text API and test it with sample audio files.
Create a task in Orkes that sends audio data to the openAI API and captures the transcribed text.

2.Emotional Analysis:

Use Hugging Faceâ€™s NLP models to detect emotions from the transcribed text or mock this process with predefined responses.
Implement a task to analyze the emotional content and provide stress management responses based on detected emotions.

3.Responder Connection:

Set up a mock API (e.g., Twilio) to alert first responders about the user's emotional state and location, ensuring timely assistance.

4.Workflow Design & Testing:

Design the entire workflow in Orkes, linking all tasks in a logical sequence.
Conduct thorough testing of each individual task and then run end-to-end tests to validate the workflow's effectiveness.
